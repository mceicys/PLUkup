This app lets the user copy all the product names and IDs from a Hobart ML-29032 Quantum Scale onto their Android device via an RS-232 to USB adapter cable. They can then search for the products by name rather than by numeric ID. They can also tag products with flags and add aliases to make items even easier to find.
